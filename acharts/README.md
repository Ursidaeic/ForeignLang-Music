# This is a scraper for the music charts database https://acharts.co/
There are two files associated with this program: the acharts.py script and the configuration file achart_config.ini. In order for the former to function, the latter needs to be supplied a variety of information, in particular a user agent and contact email address in order to ensure that we comply with the ethical scraping practices outlined by James Densmore [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01)

In order to use this script, all you have to do is fill out the information in the acharts_config file and run the acharts.py file. When the script has finished, you will find your JSON serialised charts data in the charts_data directory. This data will be in the form of a Python dictionary in which each key is a given week of the year and each value a list of the songs and artist(s) in order of chart position.
