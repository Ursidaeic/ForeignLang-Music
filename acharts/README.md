>There are two files associated with this program: the acharts.py script and the configuration file achart_config.ini. In order for the former to function, the latter needs to be supplied a variety of information, in particular a user agent and contact email address in order to ensure that we comply with the ethical scraping practices outlined by James Densmore [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01)
