        "text": "When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected Jesus Christ as the savior. \n\nHeaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it‚Äôs full of joy. \n\nHell is very terrible and it‚Äôs very very hot, you can‚Äôt survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don‚Äôt even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed,\nThe thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity,\nAgain after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) ‚ÄúAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.‚Äù \n\nRealise that you deserve hell for your sins; \nRomans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH.¬†In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit.¬†They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later.¬†Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12).¬†Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are¬†not¬†the same.¬†Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead.¬†The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15).¬†All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at¬†The Great White Throne of Judgment¬†and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.¬† \n\nSo how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven? \n\nFirst thing first; Believing at Jesus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins.\nIt's your choice but know that rejecting Jesus Christ will send you the wrong direction. \n\nHebrews 10:4, 10¬† For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.\nBy the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. \n\nAny other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n\nNo works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that. \n\nEphesians 2:8-9¬† For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\nNot of works, lest any man should boast. \n\nBelieve and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death. \n\nAfter believing at Jesus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c. \n\nRomans 6:10-11¬† For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.\nLikewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n\nAs a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. \n\nAlso grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..",

One such panel show was 8 out of 10 Cats, it was this panel show that showed me just how brilliant comedians could be, it was 8 Out of 10 Cats that got me actively interested in seeking comedy. And I have to say it was Sean Lock that did that for me. I've had a lot of hard times since that first time watching Sean be a brilliant funny man, and in those times I turn to comedy, I imagine I would have found comedy somewhere down the line, but the man that introduced me to that world was Sean Lock, and him not being on this earth is so incredibly unfair. Thank you Sean, for showing me that the world isn't always doom and gloom, and even when it is, there's usually a laugh to be found somewhere.",

I am a American and honestly can't remember how many years ago that I discovered Sean Lock's career. I know Jimmy Carr was involved lol. Sean's voice was my background noise falling asleep, he was my escape from this horrible world, he was my everything when I needed a \"pick me up\".  My heart shatters for the people that knew him well. As much as we all will want more Sean Lock....the classics will never get old. ü•ïü•ïü•ïü•ïü•ïü•ïü•ï",

        "text": "Sean Lock is one comedian on my VERY small list of jokesters that make me laugh constantly, no matter how many times I re-watch his best bits. He was the type of comedian that, you could recite one of his jokes along with him and despite knowing the punchline, his personality and delivery shone through, making you laugh every time, no matter what. The type of comedian that, you knew, the moment his brain engaged, you could see his eyes flash to life when asked a question or was prompted, what was gonna come out of his mouth was always gonna be comedy gold. You were nearly laughing before he finished speaking because, knowing he was always on it, you were gonna laugh anyway. The impact he had on his friends and his audiences was always a sight to behold, you always felt and sense of true friendship between everyone and the raw reaction he got from them whenever he spoke was always so wholesome and heartwarming. He inspired you to be that kind of person to you OWN friends. If you're the \"comedian\" or \"jester\" of your friend group, he made you feel like you should do the same thing for your own friends, make them laugh and feel good whenever you can, or even doing the same thing for strangers, be it being a madman in public and making strangers laugh from your sheer weirdness, doing stand-up yourselves, or even just making content on YouTube and hoping that you can make, at the very least, ONE person laugh from what you do. It takes a special kind of comedian to make you feel like that after a handful of jokes, but Lord knows, Sean Lock was one of them, and it's such a shame that one of Britain's best, was taken so soon. I just hope he knows how much he's loved and how much he's dearly missed. Rest in Peace Mr. Sean Lock, may you be reunited with Claude way up there with the greats.",

        "text": "As a Canadian I didn‚Äôt have the privilege of seeing Sean Lock on TV all the time. I first discovered Sean Lock in June 2018 just after I had been hospitalized for severe degenerative disc disease in my spine and chronic sciatica. I was completely incapacitated for a month, I couldn‚Äôt move off of the livingroom floor and all I did was watch 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown on YouTube. The entire time I was dealing with my back and not able to move my cat Cheshire never left my side, not even for a second. My mom even had to bring her a litter box and food beside me because she didn‚Äôt want to leave me alone. Then in January 2019 my cat Cheshire died in my arms after she had been struggling with congestive heart failure, as she was trying to take her final breath she grabbed on my eye with her claws and pierced my eyelids with her claws, that of course sent me to the hospital. I couldn‚Äôt do much at all when I got home because there was a lot of damage to my eye and it was completely swollen shut. I also had no coordination to walk around because I could only see out of one eye. I was going through so much and I didn‚Äôt have time to process my cat dying and me being hurt so all I did was watch Countdown. Then in October 2019 my family and I suffered our biggest loss ever when 4 family members ages ranging from 97 years old to 8 years old all died for different reasons all in the same month. Sean Locks humour is what got me through that extremely tough time. My brother and I stayed up most nights and that show is what helped us distract ourselves from everything that just happened. I will forever be grateful to Sean Lock and the whole cast of 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown. He will be extremely missed. RIP Sean Lock üíî",

        "text": "World War III Has Begun; How It Unfolds Depends on Us\n\nWe think of the Russia-Ukraine war as a local conflict, but it is much more than that; it is a global war on multiple fronts. The war is not only a military conflict; it is also an economic war of attrition. With skyrocketing gas prices and shortage of staples, people all over the world are feeling the consequences of the war.\n\nThis war is transforming the entire modus operandi of humanity. Since the dawn of time, we have been accustomed to living by the motto, ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest.‚Äù By and large, the rule was that the strong determined the rules, and the rules were often abusive toward the weak. Now, it seems like a new mindset has set in: Wanting something and being strong enough to take it does not mean that the world will accept it.\n\nThe war, therefore, is being fought on the inside no less, and perhaps more than on the outside. Our very makeup is changing from abusive to cooperative, from narcissistic to altruistic.\n\nIt hurts, and it will not happen without a struggle, but it is irreversible. This is the path of our evolution toward the purpose of our creation‚Äîto encompass within us all of creation. To do that, we must come to care for it, just as a mother encompasses her child through her maternal love.\n\nThe struggle to transition from our current uncaring and mean approach to all creations but ourselves, into wise and compassionate beings is called ‚Äúthe war of Gog and Magog‚Äù or Armageddon.\n\nSince the war is about our inner makeup, we can fight it within us. If we object to struggling with ourselves over who will rule‚Äîthe ego or love‚Äîthe physical reality will force us to choose love nonetheless. However, it will do so by hurting us in a very physical way.\n\nThe war in Eastern Europe is nothing compared to what we might have to endure if we resist the process. The horrific descriptions of our sages and prophets hint at it, and we would not want to live through it.\n\nAlternatively, we can fight this war within us without firing a single bullet. The choice is in our hands. All we need is to continue in the same direction that nature is already leading us: toward connection. If we make an effort to care for one another, even though initially we don‚Äôt, then we are moving in the right direction. If we try to resolve conflicts not with guns or even legal battles, but by strengthening the care and friendship between us, then we are saving lives and sparing torments from countless people.\n\nIn conclusion, let us try to rise above the hatred and see the human on the other side, who suffers too. Let us think that this war was given to us so we would think about each other more than we have so far. After all, were it not for this war, we would not notice one another. Now that it is here, we are no longer indifferent. Although our feelings our currently negative, now that we are aware of them, we can work on them together and turn them around. These are the wars of the Messiah who moshech [Hebrew: pulls] us out of the ego, and into mutual love .",

As the House was being seated, I was tasked with giving him his ‚Äú5 Minute Cue‚Äù for showtime. I popped backstage and was greeted by the sight of Sean in white boxer shorts with his trousers around his ankles hopping about rushing to get them on. I didn‚Äôt even have time to say anything before he immediately quipped: ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, I normally charge extra for this part of the show P****, but seen as it‚Äôs you...‚Äù\n\nJust as Lisa Tarbuck said in the VT, people who make us laugh share a rare and special gift that leaves a lasting impression on us. Mine was a brief moment just shared between he and I, and I realise now how special that was - he didn‚Äôt have to make a joke about it, it was just who he was, and the world was a better place for him being in it. I think we can all pay that forward. It‚Äôs the least we could do.\n\nSo yeah‚Ä¶THANK YOU SEAN. x",

God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you‚Äôve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all\nNot wanting any to perish but all to be saved \n\nToday and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you‚Äôre life and you‚Äôre heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you‚Äôre Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity \n\n God loves you so much God doesn‚Äôt force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you‚Äôre sins \n\nGod wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved \n\nthe judgement of God is near with all that‚Äôs happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it‚Äôs obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you‚Äôre sins separate you from God. God doesn‚Äôt want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you‚Äôre place paying the price for you‚Äôre sins \n\nreceive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today \n\nJohn 3 \nFor God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.\n\nWhoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. \n\nThis is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned\n\n. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right‚Äîmorally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are‚Äîaccomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God‚Äôs help, in dependence on Him].‚Äù‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3:16, 18-21‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠\n\nFor the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans 6.23\n\n2 Peter3\n\n 9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins",

I think it was because he made me laugh probably more than any person ever, and he just seemed like a good mate you might spend hours with down the pub. The whole bit on Countdown, when he did \"The rectum of the year\" is literally one of the funniest things I have watched in my life, only made even better by Claudia Winkleman sitting beside him and losing it just like I was.",

They have also apologised for placing such corrupt obligations on citizens in the first place.\n\nThey also noted that this is mostly an issue for elderly people who still feel afraid not to attend services every Sunday.\n\nSome people might think this was a matter which should be raised with the religious organisations themselves, but remember the Roman Catholic church is the most criminal religious organisation in the world.\nIt is a matter for the Civil Authorities, because it involves the infringement of citizens freedom of choice to attend a service or not. \nQ.E.D.",

I'm an American (and I agree with his critiques of Americans!) and only \"discovered\" him a year or so ago when I started watching shows like \"8 Out of 10 Cats\" here on YouTube. In fact, that's how I got to be familiar with a lot of the comedians in this tribute. It's this weird \"connection\" fans can feel for people who we've never met yet who managed to touch our lives. I hope it's true what Harry Hill said - that Sean Lock's family finds some comfort from the outpouring of emotions from all us strangers out here, whose time in this life were made just a little more bearable thanks to getting to share a world with him.",

God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you‚Äôve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all\nNot wanting any to perish but all to be saved \n\nToday and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you‚Äôre life and you‚Äôre heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you‚Äôre Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity \n\n God loves you so much God doesn‚Äôt force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you‚Äôre sins \n\nGod wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved \n\nthe judgement of God is near with all that‚Äôs happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it‚Äôs obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you‚Äôre sins separate you from God. God doesn‚Äôt want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you‚Äôre place paying the price for you‚Äôre sins \n\nreceive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today \n\nJohn 3 \nFor God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.\n\nWhoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. \n\nThis is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned\n\n. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right‚Äîmorally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are‚Äîaccomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God‚Äôs help, in dependence on Him].‚Äù‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3:16, 18-21‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠\n\nFor the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans 6.23\n\n2 Peter3\n\n 9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins",

As they mentioned, a comedian that can make comedians laugh is extremely rare.

My question is this: If a man tells a woman quite openly that she is the object of his sexual fantasies, is that offensive or is that a compliment?",

Just as is said in the video, every time he laughed was like getting an approving nod from the headmaster, and you could see that even though the joke had completely blind-sided him he wasn't ashamed to admit it and laugh along with his friend.\n\nSo long, Sean.

You'd laugh first, as in \"normal\" comedy and only on reflection you'd be shocked at where he took you and how the hell does a mind even come up with that stuff.

There's a magic to seeing for the first time a new episode with Sean and I guess I'll keep trying to save that for as long as I can. Tributes are much much worse, I know I'll start bawling my eyes out if I watch them. I was finally able to bring myself to watch this one, and true enough, I can't stop crying, especially when Lee Mack quoted \"I've had a really good life, you know?\" I haven't even met Sean. I'm not from the UK. Only found him on YT a few years ago and here I am, devastated with his death.\n\nYou have had a good life. Because you've managed to make everyone else's life a little bit better with you in it. Thank you Sean Lock.",

But they were performing together before that with Mark Lamarr & Toby Longworth in the late 80s doing the rubber bishops stuff.\n\nYou can see the tears in bills eyes & can see that he‚Äôs taken it worse than anyone. He‚Äôs probably been crying for months about it. Even present date March 2022 & he still regularly tweets photos of them both together saying how much he misses him.",

I disagree with that, so I just simply don‚Äôt listen it, I don‚Äôt tweet about it, or call for them to be canceled, I just turn it off and don‚Äôt support them monetarily.  Comedy needs to be the same way again. If they joke about a topic you don‚Äôt like, don‚Äôt support them with your attention.  Simple as that. That‚Äôs what I was meaning.

This was the first joke I heard him say and the very first time I‚Äôd heard him speak.  I knew I‚Äôd love him after that.  I‚Äôd never heard of countdown or 8 out of 10 cats before.
